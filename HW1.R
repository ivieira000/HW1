sample(x = 1:6, size = 20, replace = TRUE)
# This line of code allows R to generate 20 random outcomes from a sample containing 6 different variables (labelled as numerical characters from 1 to 6).
# "Replace = TRUE" means that each number can be drawn more than once, simulating what rolling a die would be like.
